# Rotation Feature Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

I have successfully added a rotation slider to the subtitle editor settings controller in the `/collage` page's `CanvasCollagePreview` component. Here are the key changes:

### 1. Added Rotation Property Support
- Added `textRotation` property to the text settings system
- Default value: 0 degrees (no rotation)
- Range: -180° to +180° as requested

### 2. Updated Canvas Rendering
- Modified the `drawCanvas` function to apply rotation transformation when drawing text
- Text rotates around its center point using HTML5 Canvas `rotate()` method
- Rotation is applied to both regular text display and export functionality

### 3. Updated UI Components
- Added rotation slider to the "Placement" tab (alongside vertical and horizontal positioning)
- Used `RotateLeft` icon from Material-UI for better visual representation
- Slider range: -180° to +180° with 1° increments
- Shows current rotation value in degrees
- **Slider Order**: Vertical Position → Horizontal Position → Rotation
- **Step Values**: All sliders use 1-unit steps (1%, 1%, 1°) for smooth control

### 4. Updated Text Area Bounds Calculation
- Modified `getTextAreaBounds` function to calculate correct bounding box for rotated text
- Ensures proper text selection and interaction areas even when rotated

### 5. Export Functionality
- Updated `getCanvasBlob` function to include rotation in exported images
- Maintains text rotation when generating final collage images

## Features Added
- **Rotation Slider**: Located in the Placement tab of the subtitle editor
- **Real-time Preview**: Text rotation updates immediately as you adjust the slider
- **Export Support**: Rotated text is preserved in the final exported collage
- **Proper Bounds Calculation**: Text interaction areas adjust correctly for rotated text

## Technical Details
- Rotation is applied using HTML5 Canvas `rotate()` method
- Rotation center point is calculated as the center of the text block
- Canvas transformation matrix is properly saved and restored
- Rotation value is stored in the text settings and persists across editing sessions

The rotation feature is now fully integrated and working alongside the existing vertical and horizontal positioning sliders.
