- FileBrowser still rejects any episode folder that is not strictly `digits + optional letters`. The new helper `isEpisodeId` (`src/types/episodes.ts:7`) is used when discovering seasons (`src/sections/@dashboard/@components/FileBrowser.tsx:1854`) and when counting MP4s (`src/utils/calculateFrameCountFromSubfolders.ts:58`). That means folders such as `special-cut`, `01-extra.mp4`, etc. are invisible in the episode selector, chip list, and frame‑count merge logic even though the TODO explicitly asked us to treat episode directories as opaque strings. Those episodes can no longer be approved or included in frame counts.
- The backend mirror of this logic still filters episode folders with the same `/^(\d+)([a-zA-Z]*)$/` regex (see `amplify/backend/function/memesrcUpdateMedia/src/index.js:912`). When `_docs.csv` regeneration runs, any episode folder that contains characters outside that pattern is skipped entirely, so the regenerated CSVs fall out of sync with what actually exists in S3 and new uploads that use suffixed IDs such as `01-v2` never get promoted.
